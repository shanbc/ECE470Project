# ECE470Project

Project_update_1:

During this experiment, we explore the usage of the UR3 arm and the vision sensor. By vision sensor, the sim.getVisionSensorImage() would provide a RGB image data. UR3 is able to move by the sim.moveToConfig() funciton. Those API implies our project goal is feasible.
