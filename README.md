# ECE470Project

Project_update_1:

During this experiment, we explore the usage of the UR3 arm and the vision sensor. By vision sensor, the sim.getVisionSensorImage() would provide a RGB image data. UR3 is able to move by the sim.moveToConfig() funciton. Those API implies our project goal is feasible. 

Project_update_2:

During this experiment, we finish the task detecting the object and send the picking task singal to the UR3 robot. Then the UR3 could successfully pick up the object at the pre-defined position and drop the object to the box. We apply the inverse kinematics to find correct joint angles in order to move the robot.
***The way to run simulation***
Download the 470.ttt file. Open the CoppeliaSim and choosing 470.ttt by clicking the "open scene". Then just start the simulation.
